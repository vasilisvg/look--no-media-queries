# Float <!-- .element: style="margin-top: -2.4em; color: hsl(193,99%,27%);" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background-video="gfx/balls-float.webm" data-background-video-loop="loop" -->

# ”But Vasilis!” <!-- .element: style="margin-top: 6em;" -->

Note: one col is easy, and can be enough

Note: If you disagree, it's easy to fix by using display inline block instead. We all know that. But there's another problem. Most Swiss people will not see it, but all italians see it directly.

Note: with floats we get this problem of things that don't clear. Or maybe we should call it the *upportunity of things that don't clear*

Note: The web was invented in Switzerland — well, technically in France, but for the sake of this argument we'll say it was invented in Switzerland. But it was definitely not invented for the Swiss. It was invented for everyone.
