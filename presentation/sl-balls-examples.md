# Layout in CSS <!-- .element: style="margin-top: -3.5em" -->


## Position: absolute;


<!-- .slide: data-background-video="gfx/balls-big-animate.webm" -->
Note: Ik heb deze animatie gemaakt om te laten zien hoe dit werkt


<!-- .slide: data-background-video="gfx/balls-medium-animate.webm" -->
Note: en daarna moest ik ook nog dit breakpoint maken. Fuck it.


## CSS Grid Layout


<!-- .slide: data-background="gfx/balls-grid-1.png" -->

Note: makkelijk om te maken. Poef, het werkt


<!-- .slide: data-background="gfx/balls-grid-2.png" -->

Note: en ook het verplaatsen van dingen is simpel Very easy. But what if there were more balls? What if there were 30? Or 60? Or a random amount every time you refresh the page? I think there are two different kinds of design: 1. you can design one single thing, like this painting of a ball, where you have complete control over how people will see things, and you have 2. system design where things are much more messy. I am more interested in messy things. 


## Float & display:inline-block


<!-- .slide: data-background-video="gfx/balls-float.webm" data-background-video-loop="loop" -->
Note: It simply works. There are some minor caveats, but we know most of those by now. 


## CSS Columns


<!-- .slide: data-background-video="gfx/balls-column.webm" data-background-video-loop="loop" -->
Note: Multi column is weird! It is very, very fluid and flexible. You shouldn't use it when you want pixel perfect design, but then you probably shouldn't use the web at all. Multi column is fantastic and people should be using it more. More about it later on.


## Flexbox

Note: and then of course there's flexbox, which is, indeed, flexible. We can emulate both float, and columns, and much, much more that we were unable to do so far.

<!-- .slide: data-background="gfx/maar-1.jpg" data-background-size="contain" -->
# ”But Vasilis!” <!-- .element: style="margin-top: 6em;" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background="gfx/but-vasilis.png" -->
Note: but maybe they should. More and more websites are starting to look the same. We can do better. I hope the next section will help.
