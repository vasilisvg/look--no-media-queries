This page is a present for Mike Kus. Without him knowing it I 
painted this fantastic illustration on a wall in my house.
The original illustration was used in The Mobile Book to illustrate
the articles about responsive web design. 

The site is built with progressive enhancement in mind. People
with less capable browsers, like IE8 or Opera Mini will be
able to read the content of the page. Some of them will see 
the right colours too. Most people will see the visual 
representation of the work though. How exactly they see it depends 
on their browser size (and font-size).
You can read more about it here: http://lovenonsense.com/231

It was created by Vasilis van Gemert on May 19th 2013.
It's owned by Mike Kus though.
