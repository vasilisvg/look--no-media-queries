1. Story about balls
2. How did I make this
	- Position absolute
	- If we had grid layout back then, I would have used that
	- The problem with these two techniques:
		- I have to nitpick every single breakpoint
		- I don’t want to nitpick, I’m lazy.
3. Explain about the things that robots make for me
	- Amor Vacui
	- Rectangles
	- Quickly skip through the rest
	- Explain that I came back from a holiday and my server generated 200 new works of art for me.
	- I expect robots to do the tedious work for me. I’ll simply tell it the constraints
4. Are there other ways to layout these balls, lazily. Without media queries?

a. float, or display: inline-block
b. Multicolumn
c. flexbox
d. quantity queries
e. viewport relative units
